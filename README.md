# AI Assistant Project

This project is a voice-controlled AI assistant built using Python. The assistant can perform tasks such as searching on Wikipedia, opening websites, telling the current time, and launching applications. It leverages several libraries such as `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, `wikipedia`, `webbrowser`, and more.
## Features

- Greet the user based on the time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- Search Wikipedia based on voice input
- Open websites (Google, YouTube, etc.) based on voice commands
- Open local folders or applications (e.g., Python folder, VS Code)
- Read out the current time
- Exit the program with a "stop" command
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required libraries:
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `wikipedia`
  - `webbrowser`
  - `os`
  - `openai` (optional, if using GPT integration)
  
Install the libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition wikipedia openai
